# science-spam

A list of spam domain names for email filtering (spamdomains.txt) and a spamassassin filter file. Filters both predatory conferences and predatory publishers.

Use the list for domain-based blocking: set your filter to route the message to SPAM if any of these phrases are detected in the domain part of the sender (or, if possible, also in reply-to) email adress.

**Scammers don't deserve any sympathy. The fact they can still operate and send out emails that are unfiltered almost daily is horrible. Science scam emails deserve to be blocked out of existence in a coordinated effort.**
