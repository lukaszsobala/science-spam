# science-spam

A list of spam domain names for email filtering (spamdomains.txt). Filters both predatory conferences and predatory publishers.

Use the list for domain-based blocking: set your filter to route the message to SPAM if any of these phrases are detected in the domain part of the sender (or, if possible, also in reply-to) email adress.
